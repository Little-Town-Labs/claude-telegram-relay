# Personal Claude Code Preferences

This file contains cross-project preferences for working with Claude Code. These instructions apply to all projects and help maintain a consistent development experience.

## Communication Style

- **Verbosity**: Balanced approach - explain key decisions and approaches, but stay focused on the task
- **Explanations**: Walk through important reasoning, mention alternatives when relevant, but avoid over-explaining simple changes
- **Tone**: Professional and objective. No unnecessary superlatives or excessive praise

## Planning & Implementation

- **Planning**: Always use plan mode for non-trivial tasks
  - Enter plan mode before implementing new features, refactors, or complex changes
  - Get explicit approval before writing code
  - Only skip planning for simple, single-step tasks
- **Decision-making**: Ask questions when multiple valid approaches exist rather than assuming preferences

## Code Quality

- **Testing**: Always write tests
  - Every feature should include appropriate tests
  - Run tests after making changes to verify functionality
  - Include unit tests for business logic, integration tests where appropriate
- **Code Style**:
  - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
  - Avoid over-engineering - keep solutions simple and focused
  - Only make changes directly requested or clearly necessary
  - Don't add features, refactoring, or "improvements" beyond what was asked
  - No unnecessary comments or docstrings on unchanged code

## Version Control

- **Commit Style**: Conventional Commits format
  - Use prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`
  - Write clear, concise commit messages
  - Focus on the "why" rather than the "what"
  - Always include: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- **Commit Timing**: Only create commits when explicitly requested
- **Safety**: Never use `--force`, `--amend`, or skip hooks unless explicitly asked

## Task Management

- **Todo Lists**: Use TodoWrite for complex, multi-step tasks
  - Create todos at the start of non-trivial work
  - Update status in real-time as work progresses
  - Mark tasks complete immediately after finishing them
  - Keep exactly one task as in_progress at a time

### Model Selection for Subagents

When using the Task tool to invoke subagents, choose the appropriate model based on task complexity:

**Opus (claude-opus-4-5) - Complex Problem Solving:**
- Deep architectural decisions requiring extensive reasoning
- Complex refactoring across multiple files
- Debugging intricate, multi-layered issues
- Novel algorithm design or optimization
- Security audits requiring thorough analysis
- Performance optimization with multiple trade-offs

**Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-5) - General Orchestration (Preferred):**
- Standard feature implementation
- Code reviews and analysis
- API design and implementation
- Database schema design
- General development tasks
- Coordinating multi-step workflows
- **This is the preferred model for most orchestration and development work**

**Haiku (claude-haiku-4) - Straightforward Tasks:**
- Simple CRUD operations
- Straightforward bug fixes
- Code formatting and linting
- File organization and renaming
- Documentation generation
- Basic testing tasks
- Quick analysis of small code sections

**Model Selection Examples:**
- Complex optimization → `model: "opus"` with `performance-optimizer`
- Standard feature → `model: "sonnet"` with `django-backend-expert` (default, preferred)
- Simple fix → `model: "haiku"` with `code-reviewer`

**Cost Consideration:** Use Haiku for simple tasks to optimize costs, Sonnet for most work, and reserve Opus for genuinely complex problems requiring deep reasoning.

### Ralph - Autonomous Development Loop

Ralph is a globally installed system that enables continuous autonomous development cycles with Claude Code. It's available as a set of CLI commands from any directory.

**Core Commands:**
- `ralph` - Main autonomous development loop with intelligent exit detection
- `ralph-setup <project>` - Initialize new Ralph projects with templates
- `ralph-import <file> [project]` - Convert PRD/specs to Ralph format
- `ralph-monitor` - Live monitoring dashboard for tracking progress

**Key Features:**
- **Autonomous loops** - Continuously executes Claude Code until project completion
- **Intelligent exit detection** - Automatically stops when objectives are complete
- **Rate limiting** - Built-in API call management (100 calls/hour, configurable)
- **Circuit breaker** - Prevents runaway loops with advanced error detection
- **Session continuity** - Preserves context across loop iterations
- **Live monitoring** - Real-time tmux dashboard showing status and logs
- **5-hour API limit handling** - Detects Claude's usage limit and prompts for action

**Common Usage:**
```bash
# Create new Ralph project
ralph-setup my-project
cd my-project
# Edit PROMPT.md with requirements
ralph --monitor

# Import existing PRD
ralph-import requirements.md my-app
cd my-app
ralph --monitor

# Advanced options
ralph --calls 50 --timeout 30 --verbose
ralph --no-continue  # Start fresh without session context
ralph --reset-session  # Reset session state manually
```

**Project Structure:**
- `PROMPT.md` - Main development instructions for Ralph
- `@fix_plan.md` - Prioritized task list
- `specs/` - Project specifications
- `logs/` - Execution logs

**Installation Location:** `~/.ralph/` and `~/.local/bin/`

**Note:** Ralph requires tmux for integrated monitoring. Test coverage: 276 tests, 100% pass rate.

## Project-Specific Information

When starting work in a new project, **always consult these files first** to understand the project structure and requirements. Do not assume - read before acting.

**Standard Project Files (in order of reading):**

1. **README.md** - Project purpose, architecture, and setup instructions
   - What the project does and why it exists
   - High-level architecture overview
   - Technology stack and dependencies
   - Setup, build, and deployment instructions
   - File structure and organization
   - Contribution guidelines

2. **project-config.json** - Machine-readable project metadata
   - Tech stack (backend, frontend, infrastructure)
   - Recommended agents for different tasks
   - Test, build, and dev commands
   - Testing requirements and frameworks
   - Primary language and tooling

3. **.claude/rules.md** - Project-specific Claude instructions (if present)

|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|
| `CLAUDE.md`               | Cross-project preferences & routing  | Markdown   | Claude (global) |
| `README.md`               | Project overview & architecture      | Markdown   | Humans & Claude |
| `project-config.json`     | Structured project metadata          | JSON       | Claude (routing)|
| `.claude/rules.md`        | Project-specific instructions        | Markdown   | Claude (local)  |
| `.claude/settings.json`   | Technical configuration              | JSON       | Claude Code     |

**Workflow:**
1. Read README.md to understand what the project is
2. Check project-config.json to know which agents to use
3. Review .claude/rules.md for project-specific patterns (if it exists)
4. Reference .claude/settings.json for permissions and environment (auto-loaded)

**Templates Available:**
See the `templates/` directory in the [LTLClaude repository](https://github.com/Little-Town-Labs/LTLClaude) for starter templates for these files.

## General Principles

- **Read before editing**: Always read files before modifying them
- **Prefer editing over creating**: Modify existing files rather than creating new ones when possible
- **Security**: Watch for common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, command injection, etc.)
- **Simplicity**: The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task
- **No time estimates**: Never provide time estimates or predictions for how long work will take
